    /*Commenting Best Practices
    Now that we have a good idea of what comments are and the several ways we
    have to write them in JavaScript, let’s talk a bit about how to properly use com
    ments to make your code easy to read:
    1. Always comment your code as you are writing it. Writing comments is
    dreadfully boring, but it is an important part of writing code. It is much more
    time efficient for you (and others) to understand what your code does from
    reading a comment as opposed to reading line after line of boring JavaScript.
    2. Don’t defer comment writing for later. Related to the previous point, deferring
    comment writing for a later time is the grown-up equivalent of procrastinating
    on a chore. If you don’t comment your code as you are writing it, you’ll prob
    ably just skip commenting entirely. That’s not a good thing.
    3. Use more English and less JavaScript. Comments are one of the few places
    when writing JavaScript that you can freely use English (or whatever language
    you prefer communicating in). Don’t complicate your comments unnecessarily
    with code. Be clear. Be concise. Use words.
    4. Embrace whitespace. When scanning large blocks of code, you want to
    ensure your comments stand out and are clear to follow. That involves being
    liberal with your Spacebar and Enter/Return key. Take a look at the following
    example:*/
        function selectInitialState(state) {
        var selectContent = document.querySelector("#stateList");
        var stateIndex = null;
        /*
        For the returned state, we would like to ensure that
        we select it in our UI. This means we iterate through
        every state in the drop-down until we find a match.
        When a match is found, we ensure it gets selected.
        */
        for (var i = 0; i < selectContent.length; i++) {
        var stateInSelect = selectContent.options[i].innerText;
        if (stateInSelect == state) {
                stateIndex = i;
                }
            }
            selectContent.selectedIndex = stateIndex;
        }   
        /*
        Notice that our comment is appropriately spaced to distinguish it from the rest
        of the code. If your comments are strewn about in arbitrary locations where
        they are difficult to identify, that just unnecessarily slows you and whoever is
        reading your code down.
        5. Don’t comment obvious things. If a line of code is self-explanatory, don’t waste
        time explaining what it does unless there is some subtle behavior you need to
        call out as a warning. Instead, invest that time in commenting the less obvious
        parts of your code.
